## 🚀 SynthShield

Synthetic Data Defense for Security & Surveillance AI

SynthShield is a synthetic data pipeline designed for privacy-safe computer vision training.

It generates realistic synthetic scenes, automatically applies bounding box annotations, and produces training-ready datasets without relying on sensitive real-world imagery.

Built in 24 hours at RevolutionUC.

Generate synthetic scenes and view:
- Raw procedurally generated environments  
- Automatically labeled outputs  
- YOLO-style training-ready data  

---

## 🧠 Problem

Modern AI systems in security, surveillance, and healthcare require large amounts of labeled data. Using real-world data introduces:

- Privacy risks  
- Regulatory challenges  
- Data exposure vulnerabilities  

---

## 💡 Solution

SynthShield replaces sensitive datasets with realistic synthetic data generated in controlled environments.

The system produces:
- Synthetic scenes  
- Automatic YOLO-style annotations  
- Visual validation of labeled outputs  

This enables safe development, testing, and validation of AI systems.
